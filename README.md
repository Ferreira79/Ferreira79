### Hi there!!! I am Victor Manuel Ferreira Martinez ðŸ‘‹

"I hold a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science and a Master's degree in Biodiversity Conservation. In addition, I have a Master's degree in Data Science and Business Analytics. My passion for climate change and sustainability has led me to work with natural capital and ecosystem services, and I have come to realize the importance of data in decision-making. As a result, I am eager to continue developing my skills in the field of data science and hope to pursue a Doctorate in the future."

"I am seeking a position where I can utilize and further develop my diverse skillset. As a data analyst, I am eager to continue learning and improving my skills. I hope to find a role where I can contribute to the analysis and interpretation of data in order to inform decision-making and drive positive impact."
